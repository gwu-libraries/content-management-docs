# Lost/Damaged/Replaced Items

## Lost & Paid (green slip only) <a href="#docs-internal-guid-b268bcef-7fff-e4c5-dddc-b58224ee7448" id="docs-internal-guid-b268bcef-7fff-e4c5-dddc-b58224ee7448"></a>

* Withdraw the old item (Update OCLC holdings if necessary)
* If retention or permanent, do not delete the old bib record
* Route the slip to MonoAcq if item was retention or permanent (slip under Glenn’s door), otherwise route slip to Collection Strategist for them to consider whether to purchase a replacement copy

## Lost & Patron Replaced

* When item is found on "Incoming - Patron Replacements" shelf:
  * DO NOT scan in anything, just place item with green slip on "Replacements" shelf
* When ready to do replacement work:
  * Add new item (make sure same edition; add “retention”, “permanent”, or “duplicate” note if present in lost item record)
  * Withdraw the old item

## Damaged & Patron Replaced

* When item is found on "Incoming - Patron Replacements" shelf:
  * Scan in damaged item to “Replacement Received” status and place on "Replacements" shelf
* When ready to do replacement work:
  * Add new item (make sure same edition; add “retention”, “permanent”, or “duplicate” note if present in lost item record)
  * Withdraw the old item

## Damaged & Ordered Replacement

* (MonoAcq will set status to “withdraw” and place damaged item on “withdraw” shelf)
* If old item includes “retention”, “permanent”, or “duplicate” note, add the same note to the item record for the ordered replacement copy
* Withdraw the old item
