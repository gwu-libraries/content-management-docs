## Adding Titles

\[to come]

## End-of-semester Changeover

These steps need to be done as soon as there is a title available for the NEXT semester/summer:

* [ ] Change the "Active until date" of the inactive service to the license end date for the new titles (the date is the same for all titles licensed for that semester/summer).
* [ ] Use "Manage Import Profiles" to update the "Swank discovery records" import profile to use the service with the new license date (essentially toggling back and forth between "Full text" and "Selected full text" each semester).
* [ ] All Swank records imported from this point forward will have the new license date.

These steps need to be done after the end of the license term for each semester:

* [ ] Delete the inactive portfolios (and empty bib records) from the inactive service. After this, the service should be inactive and empty and ready for a new "Active until date" once that information becomes available at a later date.
