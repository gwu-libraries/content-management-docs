# NVN / Himmelfarb

## Introduction

This policy is a basic list of information where procedures either differ from our standard Cataloging practices or at least require being mentioned. Typically a salesforce ticket is created for RDG by Himmelfarb staff alerting us of the titles being sent to us. Items are delivered to RDG by Gelman Loading Dock staff.

## Receiving

<< What do RDG folks need to know about receiving NVN materials? >>&#x20;

## Cataloging

Because Himmelfarb purchases the NVN materials, but LAI manages the circulation of items at VSTC, there should already be a record in the NZ with Himmelfarb holdings attached. This record may or may not be the best record. In addition to normal cataloging procedures, follow the following steps for NVN items:&#x20;

* Search for title in NZ, Himmelfarb there
* After copying NZ record to the IZ:
  * Add a new holdings, with 852 \$$b vstcl \$$c nursing
  * Note there is no oversize for this location
* Include prefix "NVN" for all call numbers

## Physical Processing

* In Alma Acquisitions â†’ Scan in items (choose Physical Processing work order)
* Place in rm 103 on NVC physical processing shelf for mono/acq staff to perform and route to NVC
* Notify Himmelfarb staff via Salesforce ticket that titles have been cataloged and sent to mono/acq staff for physical processing and routing to NVC
