# Media

## Introduction

This policy is a guide to the cataloging specifics relating to physical media resources (DVD; DVD-R; CD; Blu-Ray). The primary purpose is to document specific MARC fields to be added in addition to the required fields listed in [.](./ "mention"); and only includes steps or data that deviates from basic cataloging.

For electronic or streaming media resources, please see appropriate documentation under appropriate areas in “Cataloging Electronic Resources.”

## Cataloging

* Consult OLAC Best Practices as needed when in doubt (see Resources page)
* Find correct record in OCLC (match on standard info: Title; Publisher etc + Running time; MARC 024/028 packaging numbers etc)
* For non-English titles may need to view the disc credits to verify what titles to record
* Add additional MARC fields particularly (046, 257, 33X, 34X, 380) see screen capture&#x20;

* Prefer use of granular RDA terms with $2 codes from RDA Registry

&#x20;  MARC 538 should match 34X data as much as possible

* Add 500 Note for DVD-R/CD-R copies either made in-house or purchased and include information about any playability restrictions&#x20;

Importing the record(s) into Alma, linking to the NZ, scanning out of the Cataloging work order department, and physical relocation of materials follow standard procedures.&#x20;

## Physical processing (RDG)

* Transfer items and packaging to lockable cases unless specifically instructed not to do so
* Available cases include single for CD or DVD/Blu-Ray (with insert for 2 discs) or multiple DVD/Blu-Ray disc (3 or more)&#x20;
* If original packaging material doesn’t fit make reduced full color copy that will fit into the case art sleeve
* Transfer any booklets from original to lockable cases or keep with discs via rubber band
* Write barcode on disc using permanent marker; black for light colored discs and silver for dark colored discs

## Physical processing (Mono Acq)

* Physical processing (includes security strip application)
* Locking cases to be prepared for shelving
