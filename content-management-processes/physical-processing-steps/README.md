# Physical Processing Steps

{% hint style="danger" %}
For Special Collections materials, the ONLY physical processing that should occur is printing a spine label. Do not attach the spine label - simply tuck it into the book for Spec staff to affix. Do not add security strips, due date slips, or stamps. But do "done" the work order before delivering the items to Spec.

* [ ] Using a computer with attached label printer, open the label printing software
* [ ] Scan the barcode of the item to be labeled
* [ ] Make sure the call number has the necessary prefixes and matches the call number written in pencil on the title page verso
  * [ ] If there is no call number written on the title page verso, or the call number in the software does not match what is penciled in, bring the item to RDG to have them address the discrepency
  * [ ] If the call number in the software does not include the necessary prefixes, contact [Matthew Bright](mailto:bright@gwu.edu) to have them added to the configuration
* [ ] Print the label
* [ ] Attach the label on the spine of the item
  * [ ] If the item is too narrow to fit the whole call number, place it on the top left corner of the cover
* [ ] Cover with clear plastic adhesive strip
  * [ ] If label placed on cover instead of spine, cut a clear piece in half and use that
* [ ] Place security strip somewhere towards the middle of the book
  * [ ] Remove the short side of green strip, place strip into book at the spine so it sticks down, close the book to properly adhere, then remove the other green strip
* [ ] Place a due date sticker on the back free end-paper or inner back cover
* [ ] Using the "Gelman Library - GWU" stamp, stamp the top, side, and bottom of the text block
  * [ ] If book is too thin, stamp inside back cover and on front free end-paper
* [ ] "Done" the work order and deliver the item to its destination
