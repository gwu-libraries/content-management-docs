Monograph Acquisitions does bindery prep

* Create ABLE lot
* Scan in items to set status: “Sent to Bindery”
* Box the items and send them to the bindery

### Step 6: Volume returns from the bindery & gets boxes for SCF

Monograph Acquisitions does final prep steps

* Attach barcodes to volumes
* In Alma, edit the item record
  * In the Process Type dropdown select blank (to manually remove the work order and put the item in place)
  * Select Temporary Location In Use: Yes
  * Select the Gelman Library> Boxed for SCF location
  * Save the item
* Physically box items to send to SCF
* Forward bindery slip & ABLE slip to Qali

The volumes at this point are part of the standard process for sending items to WRLC
