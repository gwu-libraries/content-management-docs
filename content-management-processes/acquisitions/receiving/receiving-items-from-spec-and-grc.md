# Receiving Items from Spec & GRC

* Special Collections will place items that need to be received on the "Spec Receiving" shelf. GRC will place items that need to be received on the \[SHELF TBD] shelf.
* Receive the item
  * Take the item from the “Spec Receiving” shelf
  * In Alma, go to Acquisitions>Receive
  * Ensure “keep in department” is checked, and status is set to “cataloging”, and check the “shelf ready” option to allow you to receive by barcode
* Scan the item barcode to receive the item (this method makes it easy to receive foreign language materials)
* Invoicing
  * Create invoice manually
    * If prepaid, mark and approve
    * If not prepaid, assign to FinOps
* Place the item on the “Cataloging - Spec” shelf
