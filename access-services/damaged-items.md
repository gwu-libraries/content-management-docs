# Damaged Items

## Item record work and flag <a href="#docs-internal-guid-f6b69316-7fff-204d-afd4-2fed74a00dbe" id="docs-internal-guid-f6b69316-7fff-204d-afd4-2fed74a00dbe"></a>

### Check retention status

Open the item record. On the “Notes” tab, check the “Internal Note 2” field. If the field is blank or “DUPLICATE”, it is not a retention or permanent copy. The retention designation is now officially recorded in the “Internal Note 2” field, not the location. While many items may still show the retention designation in the location, that can no longer be relied on as accurate, and a future project will be consolidating location codes so that the retention status will only be shown in the internal note.

### Create work order

After exiting the item record, click the “...” button for the item, and select “Work Order”.

On the work order creation screen:

* Choose Process Type: “Acquisition technical services”
* Check the “Do not pick from shelf” checkbox, because you have the item in hand and it doesn’t need to be pulled from the shelf
* No note is needed because you’ll be including the flag with the book
* Choose the Managing Department “gelman Content Management”

Then click “Submit” to create the work order.

NOTE: Do NOT add or change the temporary location--this is no longer necessary because we are using the work order.

### Fill out blue flag

* If item has Roman script language, circle Y, otherwise, for non-Roman script, circle N.
* If item internal note 2 is “RETENTION” or “PERMANENT”, circle Y, otherwise, circle N.

## Content Management shelves

### Place on “Incoming” shelves in Content Management

Bring the damaged items to the “Incoming” section of shelves in the Content Management workroom, Gelman 103.

* Place all damaged retention or permanent books on the “Incoming - Damaged Retention” shelf.
* Place all damaged non-retention books on the “Incoming - Damaged Non-retention” shelf.

If there are more damaged books than can fit on these shelves, please place them on a book truck with a clear note that they are incoming damaged books.
