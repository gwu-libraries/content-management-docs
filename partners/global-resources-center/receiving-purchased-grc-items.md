No need to email Glenn or Ernest to have them receive or invoice the item--they will do this when the item is in Content Management.
{% endhint %}

* Barcode the item
  * Place barcode on the item
* Edit item record
  * Find the item in Alma (which will have been created when the item was ordered)
  * Update the auto-generated short barcode to the real barcode you just placed on the physical item
  * Check/correct the location where the item will go
  * NOTE: If there are multiple volumes of the same title, only one item will exist in Alma. Update the item record with the barcode of the first volume in the set, and place yellow "Volume not in Alma" flags in all subsequent volumes. Do not add any additional item records--RDG will create them when we catalog the title.
* Bring items to Content Management room 103 and place on “**Receiving - GRC (purchased)**” shelf (in the Receiving section of shelving, not the Incoming section).

[Monograph Acquisitions will receive and invoice the items, and transfer them to RDG for cataloging.](../../content-management-processes/acquisitions/receiving/receiving-items-from-spec-and-grc.md)
