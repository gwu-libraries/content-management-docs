# Serials Holdings Formatting

### Introduction <a href="#docs-internal-guid-5da40877-7fff-f512-d63f-abc51d460408" id="docs-internal-guid-5da40877-7fff-f512-d63f-abc51d460408"></a>

The following comes from [ANSI/NISO Z39.71-2006 (R2011) Holdings Statements for Bibliographic Items](https://www.niso.org/publications/z3971-2006-r2011)

### 5.5 Extent of Holdings Area <a href="#docs-internal-guid-5da40877-7fff-f512-d63f-abc51d460408" id="docs-internal-guid-5da40877-7fff-f512-d63f-abc51d460408"></a>

The Extent of Holdings Area consists of the following data elements: name of unit, extent of unit, enumeration, chronology, and specific extent note.

&#x20;

The Extent of Holdings Area may be repeated when needed for parts of a multipart unit. In such cases, those data elements present appear in the sequence set out in Table 3.2.

&#x20;

Holdings may be recorded as an itemized statement or as a compressed statement, or as a combination of the two.

&#x20;

Punctuation conventions specified for the Extent of Holdings Area are summarized in Table 3.1.&#x20;

&#x20;

The next sections, [5.5.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.hvpjg0u9npf5) through [5.5.1.6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.d784pwu7q1j7), present guidelines on the Extent of Holdings Area. Sections [5.5.2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.g7rbw1iel8s0) through [5.5.6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.ecxce85kx8fs) present the rules on the Extent of Holdings Area.

&#x20;

#### 5.5.1 Guidelines on Extent of Holdings Area

This section presents guidelines on choice of data element; itemized and compressed holdings statements; secondary bibliographic units; enumeration and chronology; gaps and non-gap breaks; and supplements and indexes.

&#x20;

**5.5.1.1 Choice of Data Element**

One of the following extent data elements must be present in this area: name of unit, extent of unit, enumeration, chronology.

&#x20;

The data element name of unit is usually given only when the holdings of a secondary bibliographic unit are being recorded. For single-part secondary units, the name of unit may be the only data element required to express Extent of Holdings.

&#x20;

The data element extent of unit is usually given only when a unit lacks sequential designations. This occurs most frequently with non-serial units.

&#x20;

The data element enumeration is used to give the Extent of Holdings for units with sequential designations. It is recorded for most serial units.

&#x20;

The data element chronology is usually associated with enumeration for serial units and is recorded in addition to the enumeration, when applicable. When no enumeration is present, chronology alone may specify the Extent of Holdings.

&#x20;

In summary, specify Extent of Holdings by one of the following:

* Name of Unit (for some single-part secondary bibliographic units)
* Extent of Unit (for units lacking sequential designations)
* Enumeration (for units with sequential designations other than dates)
* Chronology (for units lacking enumerative sequential designations)
* Enumeration and Chronology

&#x20;

**5.5.1.2 Itemized and Compressed Holdings Statements**

An itemized statement consists of a listing of each part of the unit held. Separate each element of an itemized statement by a blank. A compressed statement records the first and last parts of a range of units when the institution holds all the units in that range. Separate the first and last parts by a hyphen.Holdings may be recorded as an itemized statement or as a compressed statement, or as a combination of the two.

Examples of itemized statement:

v.1 v.2 v.3 v.4 v.5

1 2 3 4 5

v.4:no.1(1993:Jan.) v.4:no.2(1993:Mar.) v.4:no.3(1993:May)

v.7:no.1(1995:spring) v.7:no.3(1995:fall) v.7:no.4(1995:winter) \[Missing issue is not shown.]

&#x20;

Examples of compressed statement:

v.1-5

1-5

v.4:no.1(1993:Jan.)-v.4:no.3(1993:May)

&#x20;

Example of itemized and compressed statement:

v.1 <1992 rev.ed> v.2-v.5 v.6 <1994 rev.ed> v.7-v.10 \[Original volumes were published in 1988; volumes 1 and 6 have been updated.]

&#x20;

Bibliographic items having a hierarchical enumeration scheme relating to the intellectual content of the parts rather than to their bibliographic publication pattern may be itemized according to the scheme provided by the publisher.

Example:

Four published volumes are:

title 24:sect.1-1 to 16-1613

title 24:sect.17-1701 to end

title 25:sect.1-1 to 18-1562

title 25:sect.18-1600 to end/title 26

&#x20;

The itemized statement does not combine the sections. The last volume uses a forward slash to

record a volume which was published with combined numbering:

title 24:sect.1-1 to 16-1613 title 24:sect.17-1701 to end

title 25:sect.1-1 to 18-1562 title 25:sect.18-1600 to end/title 26

&#x20;

Compressed statement at summary level (level 3):

title 24-26 \[There are no gaps in this range.]

&#x20;

**5.5.1.3 Secondary Bibliographic Units**

The Extent of Holdings area may include holdings for secondary bibliographic units if they are included explicitly or implicitly in the bibliographic record associated with the item identifier. An Extent of Holdings area may include only secondary bibliographic units because the basic unit is not held. At the summary level (level 3), secondary bibliographic units need not be separately recorded if the resulting statement is unambiguous.

Examples:

“Teacher’s guide” 2 v.

&#x20;

v.1-19

or,

v.1-19 + “suppl.” v.1-12

&#x20;

1 kit

or,

1 booklet + 1 sound cassette + 1 guide

1 score with 7 parts

or,

1 score + 1 piano conductor part + 2 first violin parts + 2 second violin parts + 1 viola part + 1 cello part

&#x20;

Supplements to a single issue of a serial unit are generally not recorded at the summary level (level 3). Supplements may be recorded at a detailed level or as mixed holdings.

&#x20;

**5.5.1.4 Enumeration and Chronology**

When both enumeration and chronology are present on the unit, both enumeration and chronology data should be recorded and displayed.

&#x20;

Enumeration and chronology data may be displayed separately, with or without parentheses. This form of display is called “separate.”

Examples of separate display:

v.1-5(1901-1905)

v.2-6,8-14,17-20 1945-1949,1951-1957,1960-1963

&#x20;

Enumeration and chronology data may be displayed adjacent to each other, with enumeration

recorded first. This form of display is called “adjacent.” The corresponding chronology is enclosed in parentheses.

Example of adjacent display:

v.1(1901)-5(1905)

&#x20;

Record enumeration and chronology data in logical sequence; that is, lowest enumeration data to highest, earliest date to latest.

&#x20;

When the enumeration and chronology data correspond with each other, they must be displayed at the same level and in the same sequence.

Examples:

v.3(1985)-5(1987)

v.1:no.11(1983:Nov.)-5:12(1987:Dec.)

&#x20;

When the enumeration and chronology data do not correspond with each other (either because they are at different levels or represent differing sequences), the chronology data recorded in the adjacent form of display reflects what appears on the publication. If the enumeration and chronology are recorded separately, record the enumeration in sequential order; record the chronology as a broad range.

Examples:

Adjacent display: v.1(1902),3(1910),6(1907)-9(1910)

Separate display: v.1,3,6-9 1902-1910

&#x20;

Example, 2 volumes per year, lacking v.6(1982):

Adjacent display: v.1(1980)-5(1982),7(1983)-21(1990)

Separate display: v.1-5,7-21 1980-1990

&#x20;

At the summary level (level 3), record only the highest level of enumeration and chronology data for multipart and serial units. The range of holdings should be broken only by the recording of gaps.

Examples:

v.10(1910),v.14(1914)-v.23(1923) \[Serial units]

v.1 v.2 v.3 v.4 v.6 OR

v.1-4,6 \[Multipart units]

&#x20;

Numbered and unnumbered series designators are an exception: the series designator and the

second-level enumeration are always recorded together. See [5.5.4.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.hgw4aqbxmze3).

&#x20;

At the detailed level (level 4), the highest level of enumeration and chronology data plus their appropriate sublevels should be recorded. The range of holdings should be broken only by the recording of gaps.

Example:

v.10:no.1(1910:Jan.)-v.10:no.9(1910:Sep.),v.14:no.2(1914:Feb.)-v.23:no.12(1923:Dec.)

&#x20;

A mixed holdings statement, which combines summary and detailed enumeration and chronology data in one holdings statement, is broken only by the recording of gaps. Whenever possible, any one segment of holdings should contain the same level of enumeration and chronology data on both sides of the hyphen.

Examples:

v.1(1970)-v.10(1979),v.12:no.3(1981:July)-v.20:no.4(1989:Oct.)

v.1-v.10,v.12:no.3-v.20:no.4 (1970-1979,1981:July-1989:Oct.)

&#x20;

**5.5.1.5 Gaps and Non-Gap Breaks**

When a range of units, enumeration, or chronology is recorded, a gap within the range is indicated by using a comma.

Examples:

v.5(1980)-6(1981),10(1985),12(1987) \[Lacking volumes 7 through 9 and 11]

1942-1990,1994- \[Lacking 1991 through 1993]

slide A-E,G \[Lacking slide F]

&#x20;

Record and display data in a positive sense; that is, emphasize that which is held rather than that which is not.

&#x20;

At the summary level (level 3), determine when a gap occurs based on whether any portion of a bibliographic unit is held by the library. In other words, at the summary level, if any part of a unit identified by a first-level enumeration is present, record the unit as held.

&#x20;

Example at level 3:

Six issues to a volume; no issues are held of volume 3; two issues are held of volume 7. A gap is recorded between volumes 2 and 4 but not between 6 and 8:

v.1(1980)-2(1981),4(1983)-8(1987)

&#x20;

At the detailed level (level 4), record a gap when any unit is missing. Separate units in an itemized statement by blanks. A comma may be used to represent a missing unit in an itemized statement. See [5.5.1.2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.rxemidahw31t).

&#x20;

Example at level 4, serial unit:

v.5:no.1(1972:spring)-v.5:no.2(1972:summer),v.5:no.4(1972:winter)

&#x20;

Examples at level 4, non-serial unit:

v.1-15,17-25 \[Compressed. Lacking vol. 16]

v.1 v.2 v.5 v.6 \[Itemized. Lacking vol. 3 and vol. 4]

or,

v.1 v.2,v.5 v.6

v:1:pt.1 v.1:pt.2 v.2:pt.2

or,

v:1:pt.1 v.1:pt.2,v.2:pt.2 \[Itemized. Lacking vol. 2, part 1]

&#x20;

A non-gap break is a break in the enumeration, chronology, or multipart units caused by units that were never published, or some other irregularity in the numbering sequence caused by the publisher. Optionally at the summary or detailed level, represent a nongap break by a semicolon. If a non-gap break occurs adjacent to a gap, a semicolon may be placed next to a comma.

Examples:

v.1(1980)-v.4(1983);,v.7(1986)-v.10(1989)\[Volume 5 was never published. Lacking volume 6.]

no.1-8;v.3:no.1- \[Detailed level. Publisher changed from “no.” to “vol. and no.” with the ninth issue.]

&#x20;

**5.5.1.6 Supplements and Indexes**

If a supplement or index with a numbering scheme independent of the basic bibliographic unit is not linked to a separate item identifier, use that numbering to record the holdings in a separate holdings statement attached to the item identifier of the parent title. Type-of-Unit designator is coded “a” for the basic bibliographic unit, “c” for supplements, “d” for indexes.

Example of three holdings statements attached to one bibliographic record:

(a) v.1(1982)- \[the basic bibliographic unit]

(c) no.1-3 \[supplements]

(d) A-L M-Z \[indexes]

&#x20;

For supplements or indexes with dependent numbering related to a particular volume or issue of the parent title, use all the hierarchical levels of enumeration and chronology data on the publication to record the holdings in a separate holdings statement attached to the bibliographic record of the parent title. Type-of-Unit designator is coded “c” for supplements, “d” for indexes.

Examples:

(c) v.31:no.8:extra ed.(1996:Apr.28)

(c) 1995:suppl.2

(d) v.106:index(1995)

(d) cumulative index no.1-26(1995:Dec.29)

&#x20;

Supplements and indexes not linked to a separate item identifier are generally considered to be at the secondary bibliographic level. Therefore they are not recorded at the summary level (level 3); they are recorded only at the detailed level (level 4).

&#x20;

Optionally, consider these supplements or indexes as part of the basic bibliographic unit; they need not be recorded if the resulting statement is unambiguous. Holdings of supplements or indexes that are linked to a separate item identifier (i.e., bibliographic record) are recorded as basic bibliographic units of that bibliographic record. Type-of-Unit designator is then coded “a” for supplements or for indexes, because the supplements or indexes are the basic bibliographic unit of their respective bibliographic records.

&#x20;

#### 5.5.2 Name of Unit

The data element Name of Unit consists of the bibliographic title of the unit, or a briefer supplied designation that describes it. Enclose the name of unit in quotation marks. The conventions for recording the name are not specified by this standard; it is suggested that an applicable existing standard, for example, cataloging rules, be used.

&#x20;

Name of unit may be used when it is necessary to identify the unit being specified. Name of unit is used to record the extent of holdings for a basic or secondary bibliographic unit. Name of unit is used primarily for non-serial units, but it is also used for a serial unit which is designated by a name. Examples include a part of a kit, accompanying material, a supplement, or a serial with several named parts all attached to one [Item Identification Area](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.mi0dluh8zqbs).

&#x20;

A plus mark separates a basic bibliographic unit from a secondary bibliographic unit.

&#x20;

Optionally, a plus mark may be used to separate two or more basic bibliographic units.

Examples:

“Statistical update for 1992”

“Supplement 1” \[Unit reads “First Supplement to the Guide”.]

“Atlas” \[Unit reads “A Demographic atlas of Northwest Ireland”.]

“Teacher’s Guide” + 1 sound cassette \[Single-part title with cassette recorded as secondary bibliographic unit]

“Aachen to Kodesh” “Koeberle to Zwischen” \[Unit carries only names of parts, no enumeration. Transcribe “to” instead of hyphen or slash.]

“Installation disk” + “Program disk” + “Help disk” \[Optional use of plus mark connecting basic bibliographic units recorded as Name of Unit]

“Statutes” pt. 1-8 + “Cases” pt. 1-7

“Tätigkeitsbericht” 1980- + “Neuerwerbungen” 1979- \[Unit is a two-part serial whose parts are distinguished only by titles (names); two basic bibliographic units.]

“Charter” ch.1-74 + “Code” titles 1-27 + “Amendments” 1935- + “Index” 1996:no.1 \[“Charter” and “Code” are multi-volume sets with a constant number of volumes. “Amendments” is a currently received annual serial. Only the latest issue of “Index” is retained. All are attached to one bibliographic record.]

&#x20;

#### 5.5.3 Extent of Unit

Extent of unit is recorded as a total count of the number of parts, usually represented by an Arabic numeral, followed by a term indicating the specific class of material. The extent of unit is recorded for bibliographic items lacking sequential designations. For units having a large number of pieces, an estimate of the total may be given.

&#x20;

If the unit is a single part, extent of unit is not necessary if name of unit is given. The extent of unit of a single-part basic bibliographic unit is optional; it may be recorded at level 2. But if the single-part basic bibliographic unit has one or more secondary bibliographic units, both must be recorded at the summary (level 3) or detailed (level 4) level.

Examples:

2 sound cassettes

1 microfiche

179 sheets

ca. 1000 items

“Appendix” \[Single bibliographic item with Name of Unit only; Extent of Unit not needed]

1 v. + “Songs” 1 sound cassette \[Single-part unit with secondary bibliographic unit. Extent of unit of the basic bibliographic unit must be recorded because there is a secondary bibliographic unit.]

&#x20;

If the units have sequential designations, treat them as enumeration, not as extent of unit.

Example:

v.1-20,50-59 \[not 30 v.]

&#x20;

#### 5.5.4 Enumeration

&#x20;

Holdings are recorded by enumeration if the unit has an enumerative sequential designation. Serial units usually have enumeration, but may have only chronology. Serial holdings are recorded in terms of enumeration or chronology or both.

&#x20;

Some multipart non-serial units have enumeration, for example, multivolume monographs. In those cases, use the enumeration to record the non-serial holdings. Monographic series with numbers on each volume may be recorded by enumeration.

&#x20;

If a bibliographic item does not carry enumeration, do not supply it.

&#x20;

Record the enumeration for serial and multipart units by giving the caption (recommended, optional), followed by the sequential designations of the pieces held. (See also [5.5.4.2, Captions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.u4e00nee2lx4))

Band 5 becomes Bd.5

volume 16, no. 3 becomes v.16:no.3

third series becomes ser.3

63 record as 63

volume 63 optionally record as 63

&#x20;

**5.5.4.1 Levels of Enumeration**

If a unit has hierarchical enumeration, holdings may be recorded at summary level (level 3), detailed level (level 4), or as mixed holdings (a combination of summary and detailed level holdings).

&#x20;

When enumeration below the first level is given, use a colon to separate each level of holdings.

Examples:

V.1:no.1

Bd.1:T.1:Nr.3

1:2:1

&#x20;

For both numbered and unnumbered first-level series designators, record the series level as the first level of enumeration. When the first level is a series, always record the second-level enumeration along with the first level. As usual, separate the first level from the second with a colon.

Examples:

Ser.3:v.1 \[The first level is a numbered series, “ser. 3”]

new ser.:v.1 \[The first level is an unnumbered “new series”]

&#x20;

Note: Holdings statements created according to this standard, Z39.71-1999, are to use the abbreviation “new ser.” followed by a colon. Holdings statements created according to Z39.42-1980 or Z39.44-1986 may use the obsolete abbreviation “n.s.” without a colon.

&#x20;

If it is necessary to record both first-level and subsequent level enumeration in the holdings statement, repeat all levels of enumeration at the beginning and end of each range held.

&#x20;

Examples:

V.1:no.3-v.29:no.4

1:10-4:24

v.2:pt.1:no.1-v.5:pt.2:no.3,v.5:pt.2:no.5-

&#x20;

A hierarchical multipart unit may have a first-order designator with a caption and enumeration, but a subsequent order designator with only a name. When recording at the detailed level (level 4), record each level as it appears on the piece, separated by a colon. When it is part of a hierarchical unit, do not enclose the name in quotation marks.

Examples of detailed, itemized statements:

v.3:text v.3:documents v.3:index

title 42:rules:sect.1-2000

v.1:1st violin v.1:2nd violin v.1:viola v.1:violoncello

v.2:1st violin v.2:2nd violin v.2:viola v.2:violoncello

v.3:1st violin v.3:2nd violin v.3:viola v.3:violoncello

&#x20;

**5.5.4.2 Captions**

Captions associated with enumeration may be recorded with the enumeration. The recording of

captions is recommended, but optional.

Example:

volume 5 becomes v.5 or 5

&#x20;

Transcribe captions associated with enumeration in the vernacular form appearing on the publication, transliterated when needed. Record captions in the singular. Optionally, captions may be translated. If the parts of a unit have no captions, do not supply captions.

&#x20;

Abbreviate captions in accordance with the appropriate portions of “Abbreviations,” in Appendix B, of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (current edition and revision) when applicable abbreviations are provided. If applicable abbreviations are not present in that list, other standard lists or ISO 832 rules may be used. If no abbreviation is available, record the caption in its full form. When two forms of an abbreviation are provided in a list, use the shorter one (for example, “v.” not “vol.”).

&#x20;

When a caption is abbreviated and ends in a period, no blank shall separate the caption and the

enumeration. An unabbreviated caption is followed by a blank.

&#x20;

When a symbol with a recognized textual equivalent appears on the piece as a caption, record the textual equivalent or its abbreviation.

&#x20;

Record captions beginning with a lowercase letter, unless the language of the caption requires an uppercase first letter.

Examples:

tome 10 becomes t.10

number 2 becomes no.2

Band 3 becomes Bd.3

volume 5 becomes v.5 not vol.5

reel 32 remains reel 32

\#6 becomes no.6

nmbr 3 remains nmbr 3

3\. Teil becomes T.3

&#x20;

Captions need not be repeated after a hyphen. However, captions may be repeated after a hyphen when needed for clarity.

Examples:

v.1-85

V.4:no.1-6:4

ser.1:v.1-ser.3:v.25

&#x20;

In an itemized multipart statement, captions, when present, are repeated before each unit.

Example:

v.1 v.1A v.1B v.2 v.2A v.3 v.4 Index \[Index volume has no caption.]

&#x20;

Optionally, record only one part of redundant captions. But record all parts of an unnumbered or numbered series caption.

Examples:

volume no. 4 becomes v.4 or no.4

bulletin no. 25 becomes bull.25 or no.25

new series volume 1 becomes n.s.:v.1

&#x20;

**5.5.4.3 Sequential Designators**

Convert all numeric information to Arabic numbers.

Examples:

VII becomes 7

six becomes 6

&#x20;

Optionally, ordinal numbers may be converted to cardinal numbers. If ordinal numbers are recorded, follow Appendix C (Ordinal Numbers), Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (current edition and revision).

Examples:

first becomes 1st or 1

troisième becomes 3e or 3

3\. Teil becomes T.3

&#x20;

Record uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters as they appear on the bibliographic item.

Examples:

23a

no.36B

v.B

&#x20;

Optionally, romanize nonroman alphabetic data.

&#x20;

When a bibliographic item is issued with combined numbering—not when bound together after receipt— separate the numbers by a forward slash.

Examples:

v.5/6

v.5:no.1/2

v.4:no.4/v.5:no.1 \[Published as a combined issue]

v.33/v.44:no.2 \[A microfilm reel or CD-ROM containing v. 33 through v. 44, no. 2.]

&#x20;

When a part of an otherwise numbered unit lacks numeric or alphabetic designation, it may be

supplied in square brackets.

Examples:

\[v.1] v.2 v.3 \[Enumeration supplied for v.1 — itemized form.]

\[v.1]-3 \[Enumeration supplied for v.1 — compressed form.]

&#x20;

In an itemized statement, or at either end of a compressed statement, record an incorrect numeric or alphabetic designation as it appears on the piece, with the correct designation following in square brackets, and preceded by “i.e.”

Example:

v.1 v.2 v.2\[i.e. 3] v.4 \[Volume 3 was incorrectly numbered by the publisher.]

not:

v.1-2\[i.e.3];4

&#x20;

In level 3 (summary) and mixed holdings, end the statement with a final hyphen if the holdings are open.

&#x20;

Optionally, a final hyphen may be used in level 4 (detailed) holdings if the holdings are open.

Examples:

16-31,33-

v.5:no.1-

&#x20;

No hyphen is used if only a single unit is held.

Example:

v.5

&#x20;

If the holdings are closed, no punctuation follows the closing enumeration.

Example:

v.1-105

&#x20;

If typographic or other designations are used on the unit in place of sequential designators, convert them to numbers if they have direct numeric equivalents.

Example:

v.1-5 \[One or more asterisks appear on the volumes representing volume numbers]

&#x20;

If converting them makes them ambiguous, represent them textually or by an appropriate symbol.

Example:

v.1-6A;\*-\*\* \[A multipart unit with seven numbered volumes and two sequential volumes numbered \* and \*\*. (Such \* volumes are often indexes.)]

&#x20;

If there are no direct numeric equivalents, see section [5.5.3, Extent of Unit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.3flrqbq7g6qo).

&#x20;

**5.5.4.4 Multiple Enumerations**

For a serial or multipart unit within a serial or multipart unit, each with its own numbering scheme, record the enumeration appropriate to the basic bibliographic unit specified in the [Item Identification Area](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.mi0dluh8zqbs).

&#x20;

For alternative enumerations, if there is a scheme of continuously incrementing issue numbers or other numbering schemes in addition to a regular scheme of enumeration, the alternative numbering scheme or schemes may be recorded, following the regular scheme of enumeration and separated by an equal sign. When alternative numbering exists, there should be correlation between the different enumeration schemes.

Examples:

v.1-3=no.1-36

**5.5.4.5 Unnumbered Issues**

If an unnumbered, named issue is linked to a separate [Item Identification Area](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeUjDB4xhLTNPlenOQudpOuHI8zRC2hhAtxYAx3s1pA/edit#heading=h.mi0dluh8zqbs), record it separately. But if it is linked to the same Item Identification Area as the rest of the units, an unnumbered, named issue may be recorded as part of a holdings string at the uncompressed and detailed level (level 4). More frequently, it will be compressed into the higher-order designator.

Examples:

Inaugural issue \[published before vol.1:no.1]

Annual directory issue

&#x20;

#### 5.5.5 Chronology

Chronology is recorded in parallel with enumeration, except when a bibliographic item carries only chronology. When only a chronological sequential designation is present, the chronology specifies the holdings. When only chronology specifies the holdings, it is not enclosed in parentheses.

&#x20;

If both enumeration and chronology are present, both may be recorded. If only enumeration is present, enumeration is recorded; chronology is not supplied. If only chronology is present, chronology is recorded; enumeration is not supplied.

&#x20;

If it is necessary to record both first-level and subsequent level chronology in the holdings statement, repeat all levels of chronology at the beginning and end of each range held.

&#x20;

Optionally, if a bibliographic item normally carries chronology data and such data is omitted from some pieces, it may be supplied within square brackets.

&#x20;

**5.5.5.1 Levels of Chronology**

Only the highest level of chronology data, the year, shall be recorded for summary (level 3) holdings.

&#x20;

With detailed level (level 4) holdings, chronology data below the first level shall be recorded when a corresponding level (detailed level) of enumeration is recorded, or when there is no enumeration.

&#x20;

In summary level (level 3) holdings, a final hyphen shall be used if the holdings are open.

&#x20;

Optionally, a final hyphen may be used in detailed level (level 4) holdings if the holdings are open.

&#x20;

Alternatively, a detailed holdings statement for a title that is currently received may be closed. (This assumes that the holdings statement will be regularly updated.)

Examples:

1969-

Bd.1(1968)-

v.5:no.1(1975:Jan.)-v.7:no.4(1977:Oct.),v.8:no.2(1978:Apr.)-

v.1:no.1(1994:spring)-v.3:no.4(1996:autumn) \[Closed, detailed level holdings statement]

&#x20;

No hyphen is used if only a single year is held.

Example:

1992

&#x20;

**5.5.5.2 Dates**

When more than one type of date is present on the bibliographic item, select the date from the following preferred dates, in this order:

Date of coverage

Date of publication

Date of copyright

Date of printing

&#x20;

Do not use the date of reprinting in the holdings statement because the chronology information should be that associated with the original work. Reprint information is properly a part of the bibliographic description of the work.

&#x20;

Always record all four digits of the year.

Example:

1993/1994, not 1993/94

&#x20;

If there is chronology data available, but the exact year cannot be precisely determined (for example, for some non-Gregorian dates), use a question mark to fill the space of the missing digit.

Examples:

198?

18??

&#x20;

If the century is not known, do not record that date.

&#x20;

Optionally, a non-Gregorian date which can be converted only to one of two Gregorian dates may be recorded as:

5757 \[1996 or 1997]

&#x20;

Record months, seasons, and days in the vernacular form, as they appear on the publication, transliterated when needed.

&#x20;

Abbreviate chronology data in accordance with appropriate portions of “Abbreviations,” Appendix B, Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, (current edition and revision) when applicable abbreviations are provided. If applicable abbreviations are not present, other standard lists or ISO 832 rules may be used.

Examples:

1989:Jan.

1987:juil.

1993:mid-Sept.

&#x20;

When chronology below the first level is recorded, use a colon to separate the year from the month. In recording chronology data that contains day notations, do not treat these as a separate hierarchical level, and do not separate them with a colon.

Examples:

1982:Feb.

1988:Feb.1 not 1988:Feb.:1

&#x20;

If chronology of less than a day is recorded, use a colon to separate time designations from the day.

Example:

1996:Oct.19:am \[Daily newspaper with both morning and evening editions]

&#x20;

If chronological time is recorded, use the 24-hour clock with hours, minutes, etc., separated by colons. Optionally the offset from Universal Time may be included.

Example:

1996:Oct.20:16:18:51.37-0400 \[Specific version of a computer file sent at 4:18:51.37 pm]

&#x20;

Use a forward slash as a separator if the chronology data for a single bibliographic unit spans a non-calendar year or more than one year.

Examples:

1989/1990- \[non-calendar date or biennial]

1990/1992 \[triennial]

&#x20;

If the holdings are closed, no punctuation follows the closing year.

Examples:

1989-1995

t.2(1980)-9(1987

&#x20;

When one calendar scheme is present on the publication, use that scheme as the basis for recording chronology data. When the Gregorian scheme and one other scheme are present on the publication, use the Gregorian scheme.

&#x20;

At the summary level (level 3), convert any non-Gregorian dates required for a holdings statement to the equivalent Gregorian dates at the highest level (usually year) and record them in Gregorian form.

&#x20;

For detailed (level 4) statements, any non-Gregorian dates required for a holdings statement may also be recorded in the Gregorian form in square brackets.
