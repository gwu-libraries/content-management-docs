This form creates a brief bibliographic record. Only the following fields are necessary in the Resource Information section:

* Title: Enter the title of the resource. This can be an abbreviated title, and can be in roman or non-roman script.
* ISBN: This is helpful if one exists on the resource.
* Additional person name: Enter the name of the collection, if applicable, e.g. “Korea Resource Center.” [See the list of collection names for the correct form of the name](../../reference/notes/collection-notes.md).
* Source: Enter any donor notes the way you want them to appear, e.g. “Gift of Prof. Someone-or-other”.
* Note: Enter any notes for RDG, e.g. “Please include the Korean title ‘Chosŏnhak’ even though it doesn’t appear on the item”.

## Physical Handling

* If non-English materials, including the OCLC number of the correct OCLC record with the item, or a printout of that record, is very helpful.
* Place the barcode on the item.
* Add orange "Rush" flag for any rush items
* NOTE: If there are multiple volumes of the same title, only one item will be created in Alma. Place barcodes on all items, but use only the barcode of the earliest volume in the set when creating the record, and place yellow "Volume not in Alma" flags in all subsequent volumes. Do not add any additional item records--RDG will create them when we catalog the title.
* Bring the item to the Content Management workroom, Gelman 103, and place on the “Incoming - GRC (non-purchased)” shelf.
* When cataloging has been completed, RDG will place the item “in transit” and deliver it to the “From RDG” shelf above the fridge in the GRC workroom.
* GRC staff scan the item in, and it will be in place and available.
