# Global Resources Center

This section of documentation covers acquisition and cataloging procedures for Global Resources Center staff and librarians. Generally, procedures are not specific to language area but instead describe processes that apply broadly across the GRC, with specific notes for language areas for any deviations/additional steps.

Since we are slowly working on revising processes for GRC collections, please reach out to RDG ([rdg@gwu.edu](mailto:rdg@gwu.edu)) if processes described here are new to you, or if you need to do something that is not covered here. We anticipate that some language areas will continue to use the previous processes for a little while.
