# GRC Serials Holdings Policy

For GRC serials that have more than one GRC holding record, the first (onsite) holding record should have one or more 866 fields that ONLY describe the issues/volumes in that location, AND an 852 $z public note that lists other GRC issues/volumes that are in other locations or attached to other holding records. Subsequent holding records will only include 866 field(s) that describe the issues/volumes in those locations, and will not have an 852 $z listing other volumes held.

The first (onsite) holding would display like this, with the note about the offsite issues displaying in the "Note" field. (The text in the note in this case is just about the offsite volumes, but it would be fine to have a longer note that says something to the effect of "GRC holds 2006-2013, with 2006-2008 held offsite."
