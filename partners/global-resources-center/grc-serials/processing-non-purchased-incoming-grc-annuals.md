# Processing Non-purchased Incoming GRC Annuals

### Barcode the item

Place barcode on the physical item

### Find title in Alma

Set the search for “All titles” and “ISSN” or “Title” -- and make sure you are searching in the institution zone (as below).

Confirm there are no orders attached to the bibliographic record.

### Identify correct holding record

Click on the “Physical” hyperlink -- this will bring up the holdings records for the print journal (as opposed to any holdings records for an electronic version of the same journal). Then click on the "Holdings" hyperlink.

If there are several holdings records, select the appropriate GRC record. There should just be one onsite GRC holding. If there are multiple, ask Cathy or RDG which holding to use, as consolidation might be necessary.

Confirm there is no PO Line on the holding record. If there is one, check with Cathy or RDG to see if this should be received using the "Receiving Purchased Incoming GRC Annuals" process.

#### Enumeration format

For recording dates/volumes/numbers: Follow the established format for each title; enumeration and frequency of publication are different for different periodicals. Here are examples of possible formats:

* **Single volume, year:** v.1 (1997); v.1 (1997)-v.2 (1998)
* **Number, year:** no.5 (1998); no.5 (1998)-no.52 (1999)
* **Year:** 2003-2005

### Add item record

In the list of holdings, view an existing item record to check the "material type" and "item policy", then go back to the list of items.

Add item. Use the same material type and item policy as the item you looked at. Enter the item's enumeration and chronology in the appropriate fields:

* Volume goes in Enum A
* Number goes in Enum B
* Year goes in Chron I

&#x20;Click "generate" next to the description field, then edit the description field if necessary for the volume information to appear correctly based on the enumeration format above.

Scan the barcode on the item into the barcode field, which should automatically save the record.

Make sure the new item shows as "in place".

### Physical processing

* [ ] Open the label printing software and scan the barcode

* [ ] Print and apply spine label, and cover with clear adhesive strip
* [ ] Add security strip
* [ ] Add due date label on back free end-paper
