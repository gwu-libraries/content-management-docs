# Processing Incoming GRC Issues

{% hint style="info" %}
**Newspapers:**

We do not check in individual issues of newspapers in Alma; they need merely to be shelved. When shelving, pay attention to the previous folders to make sure we do not have large gaps in newspaper holdings. If you notice a gap, let the Supervisor know.
{% endhint %}

### Find title in Alma

Set the search for “All titles” and “ISSN” or “Title” -- and make sure you are searching in the institution zone (as below).

### Identify correct holding record

Click on the “Physical” hyperlink -- this will bring up the holdings records for the print journal (as opposed to any holdings records for an electronic version of the same journal). Then click on the "Holdings" hyperlink.

If there are several holdings records, select the appropriate GRC record. There should just be one onsite GRC holding. If there are multiple, ask Cathy or RDG which holding to use, as consolidation might be necessary.

### Edit holding record

Confirm that the holdings record matches the item in hand; then click "Edit" to open the Metadata Editor.

Check in regular issues of periodicals on the lines starting with “866.” Use the “867” tag for supplemental issues, and the “868” tag for indexes. If you need to add a line, press F8 or click on Edit > Add Field.

For unbound periodical issues, both indicators in the 866 field should be blank (4 1 should only be for bound volumes). Enumeration information goes in the $a. $8 is not necessary. Enumeration should include a range as long as there are no missing issues, so it should sometimes be possible to change the last issue in the range instead of adding a new line/range.

Select "Save and release record" when finished. Make sure that no records remain listed in the metadata editor.

#### Enumeration format

See the [Volume Numbering page](../../../reference/volume-numbering.md) for information and examples of numbering.

### Check Primo

Anytime you update a record, check the entry in Primo: this allows you to see how the record displays to patrons.

### Physical processing

To prepare the item for shelving, stamp the item with the date stamp and insert a security strip.

### Shelve the item
