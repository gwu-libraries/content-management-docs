## Item record work and flag <a href="#docs-internal-guid-84477608-7fff-133c-7a44-f95671c4a988" id="docs-internal-guid-84477608-7fff-133c-7a44-f95671c4a988"></a>

### Create work order

If you are able to identify the correct item record (usually by barcode, but if there is a barcode problem you might be able to identify the item through other means), create a work order on the item.

In the list of item records, click the “...” button for the problem item, and select “Work Order”.

On the work order creation screen:

* Choose Process Type: “Acquisition technical services”
* Check the “Do not pick from shelf” checkbox, because you have the item in hand and it doesn’t need to be pulled from the shelf
* No note is needed because you’ll be including the flag with the book
* Choose the Managing Department “gelman Content Management”

Then click “Submit” to create the work order.

### Fill out red flag

\[ADD IMAGE OF NEW FLAG]

* If you were able to create a work order, choose one of the options in the Work Order section and provide any other necessary information.
* If you were unable to create a work order because an item record does not exist in Alma, or because the correct item record couldn’t be identified, choose an option in the No Work Order section.

## Content Management shelves

### Place on “Incoming” shelves in Content Management

Bring the problem items to the “Incoming” section of shelves in the Content Management workroom, Gelman 103. Place on the “Incoming - Problem Items - Stacks” shelves.

If there are more problem items than can fit on these shelves, please place them on a book truck with a clear note that they are incoming problem items.
