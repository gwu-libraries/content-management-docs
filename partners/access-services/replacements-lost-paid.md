# Replacements / Lost & Paid

{% hint style="info" %}
This is part of the overall [Lost & Paid / Patron Replacements](../../reference/workflow-overviews/lost-and-paid-patron-replacements-overview.md) workflow
{% endhint %}

* Fill out green “Replacement/Lost Book Routing Slip”
* Must include date, initials, check appropriate box, title, barcode.
* If “Lost and Paid For”: take the slip to 103 and place in the “Incoming Lost & Paid Slips” tray.
* If “Lost Replacement Copy” or “Damaged Replacement Copy: Make sure that all checkboxes on the “Replacement Copy Checklist” are complete; include the slip with the replacement item (and damaged item if available) and place on the “Incoming - Patron Replacements” shelf in 103. If there are more replacement books than can fit on these shelves, please place them on a book truck with a clear note that they are incoming patron replacements.
* For damaged items **only**, create a work order for “Acquisition Technical Services” on the damaged item. For all other items, no Alma steps are necessary.
  * In Alma, click the “...” button for the item, and select “Work Order”.
  * On the work order creation screen:
    * Choose Process Type: “Acquisition technical services”
    * Check the “Do not pick from shelf” checkbox, because you have the item in hand and it doesn’t need to be pulled from the shelf
    * No note is needed because you’ll be including the flag with the book
    * Choose the Managing Department “gelman Content Management”
    * Then click “Submit” to create the work order.
