## Item record work and flag <a href="#docs-internal-guid-11ac45d3-7fff-b5ad-4451-cac0238b3718" id="docs-internal-guid-11ac45d3-7fff-b5ad-4451-cac0238b3718"></a>

### Fill out green flag

### \[Add instructions for filling out the flag here]

For damaged books where the patron has provided a replacement copy, place a rubber band around both the damaged and replacement items, create the work order on the damaged item, and place it on the “Incoming - Patron Replacements” shelf in 103. No green slip is necessary if the damaged item is included with the replacement item.

### Create work order

Find the record for the lost or damaged item record in Alma, then click the “...” button for the item, and select “Work Order”.

On the work order creation screen:

* Choose Process Type: “Acquisition technical services”
* Check the “Do not pick from shelf” checkbox, because you have the item in hand and it doesn’t need to be pulled from the shelf
* No note is needed because you’ll be including the flag with the book
* Choose the Managing Department “gelman Content Management”

Then click “Submit” to create the work order.

## Content Management shelves

### Place on “Incoming” shelves in Content Management

Bring the replacement items (along with the damaged items if damaged patron replacement) to the “Incoming” section of shelves in the Content Management workroom, Gelman 103. Place on the “Incoming - Patron Replacements” shelf.

If there are more replacement books than can fit on these shelves, please place them on a book truck with a clear note that they are incoming patron replacements.
