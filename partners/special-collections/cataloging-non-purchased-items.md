* This form creates a brief bibliographic record. Only the following fields are necessary in the Resource Information section:
  * Title: Enter the title of the resource. This can be an abbreviated title, and can be in roman or non-roman script.
  * ISBN: This is helpful if one exists on the resource.
  * Additional person name: Enter the name of the collection, if applicable, e.g. “Middle East Institute Collection at Gelman Library”.
  * Source: Enter any donor notes the way you want them to appear, e.g. “Gift of Prof. Someone-or-other”. You can include subfield indicators here, which is helpful but not necessary.
  * Note: Enter any notes for RDG, e.g. “Please include the Korean title ‘Chosŏnhak’ even though it doesn’t appear on the item”.

* Scroll down, select the item’s location, and add the item barcode. NOTE: for items that will go to WRLC, for the moment set the location as “scrc” and the location will be changed when the item is sent to WRLC.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As a workaround for an error that sometimes occurs, if you encounter an error message scanning in the item, try choosing “Automatically print slip: yes” and scanning in again.
{% endhint %}

## Physical Handling

* Barcode the item to your preference--either affixing the barcode to the item or placing it on a flag that you include with the item.
* Bring the item to the Content Management workroom, Gelman 103, and place on the “Incoming - Received by Spec” shelf.
* When cataloging has been completed, RDG will place the item “in transit” and deliver it to the “From RDG” shelf in the Special Collections Research Center.
* Spec staff scan the item in, and it will be in place and available.
