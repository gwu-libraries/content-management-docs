# Receiving Purchased Items

## Special Collections Steps <a href="#docs-internal-guid-bf8da6fd-7fff-aa97-d0f9-9276637464f9" id="docs-internal-guid-bf8da6fd-7fff-aa97-d0f9-9276637464f9"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
No need to email Glenn or Ernest to have them receive or invoice the item--they will do this when the item is in Content Management.
{% endhint %}

* Barcode the item
  * Place barcode on the item or on a flag
* Edit item record
  * Update barcode to the barcode on the piece
  * Optional: check/correct the location where the item will go
* Bring item to Content Management room 103 and place on “**Spec Receiving**” shelf (in the Receiving section of shelving, not the Incoming section).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The "Spec Receiving" shelf is a new shelf that has not been used until March 2022, so please make sure items are placed there if they still need to be received in Alma!
{% endhint %}

[Monograph Acquisitions will receive and invoice the items, and transfer them to RDG for cataloging.](../../content-management-processes/acquisitions/receiving/receiving-items-from-spec-and-grc.md)
