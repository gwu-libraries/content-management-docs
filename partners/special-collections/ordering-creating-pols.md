# Creating POLs for ordered items

### If ordered through GOBI

Nothing special needed - use the regular GOBI process.

### If you have ordered and paid for the item from another vendor

Once the order is complete, [fill out the POL creation request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVWlFyNfD5\_46exGo5swWweG9AhJiUSl1qepoMLn1Z7jPSaA/viewform) for each title ordered.

* OCLC number is not needed
* Vendor reference number is an order number provided by the vendor and is optional
* Fund code, vendor code, and reporting codes need to match the Alma codes exactly
* If you would like to be notified (or have someone else be notified) once the item is cataloged and ready, enter the G-number of the person to be notified

### If Glenn needs to order or pay

Email Glenn, who will create the POL in Alma.
