# AH Small Collection

In addition to the museum objects in the Albert H. Small Washingtoniana Collection, there is a small library of about 750 items focusing on the history of the Washington region. Their collection is non-circulating. The collection displays to users in the main GW Libraries Primo search, and we plan to add a separate AH Small Primo instance that only displays the holdings of the collection library for their use. Including the AH Small Washingtoniana library in Alma and Primo brings visibility to resources that are available to GW students and faculty who might not otherwise discover this valuable specialized collection. There is a curator who manages all of AH Small, including the library collection.

RDG has chosen to take a more active role in cataloging for this collection since the curator doesn’t have a library background and the number of items added each year (1-2 dozen) is so small that the time spent training and supporting someone there to catalog would take longer than just cataloging the items. Though the collection is smaller, it has languished in recent years. RDG has completed an inventory to identify items in the collection that have not been cataloged and is in the process of cataloging these items, with the goal to complete this work—performed onsite a few hours per month—by summer 2024. We expect that once this backlog is complete, resources required to provide ongoing support for this collection will be minimal.
