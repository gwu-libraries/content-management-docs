# Content Management Team

## Welcome to our documentation site

The one stop shop for documentation of workflow processes for the Content Management team at the GW libraries. If you need to do something that isn't listed here, please email [rdg@gwu.edu](mailto:rdg@gwu.edu).

{% hint style="info" %}
Information is organized on this site by the department doing the work. In this way, some workflows are split between different areas if there are different steps performed by people in different departments. This way, if you are in Access Services, you can simply navigate to the [Access Services](partners/access-services/) section of the website to see ALL documentation that applies to you.
