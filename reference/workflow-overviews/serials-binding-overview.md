## Stacks Serials Binding Process

1. [Building Operations and Media Reserves Supervisor selects title to be bound (LibOps)](../../partners/library-operations-team/serials-binding-libops-steps.md)
2. [Prepare bindable units (LibOps)](../../partners/library-operations-team/serials-binding-libops-steps.md#step-2-prepare-bindable-units)
3. [Check to see if volumes should be discarded or sent to WRLC (LibOps)](../../partners/library-operations-team/serials-binding-libops-steps.md#step-3-check-to-see-if-volumes-should-be-discarded-or-sent-to-wrlc)
4. [Preliminary Bindery Prep (LibOps)](../../partners/library-operations-team/serials-binding-libops-steps.md#step-4-preliminary-bindery-prep)
5. [Final Bindery Prep (MonoAcq)](../../content-management-processes/bindery/serials-binding-monoacq-steps.md#docs-internal-guid-06d35ff4-7fff-f045-2413-1b5a4dbfd342)
6. [Volume returns from the bindery & gets boxes for SCF (MonoAcq)](../../content-management-processes/bindery/serials-binding-monoacq-steps.md#step-6-volume-returns-from-the-bindery-and-gets-boxes-for-scf)
7. [Update holding records (SERG)](../../content-management-processes/serials/serials-binding-serg-steps.md)



## GRC Serials Binding Process

This is similar to the stacks process, above, but involves GRC staff in the initial steps and is decoupled from decisions on what to send to the WRLC Shared Collections Facility. All GRC serials return to GRC stacks after being bound.
