# Physical Processing Reference

## Barcodes

Apply a library supplied barcode to upper right hand corner of the outside back cover, with the top edge of the barcode 1/4" from the cover and the edge of the barcode 1/2" from the spine.

## Oversize designations (Gelman Stacks)

| Size                                              | Location             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| <p>30 cm tall and less<br>24 cm wide and less</p> | Stacks               |
| <p>31-38 cm tall<br>25-30 cm wide</p>             | Stacks Oversize      |
| <p>>38 cm tall<br>>30 cm wide</p>                 | Stacks Flat Oversize |

_All sized are rounded up to the next cm. So 30.0cm = 30cm, but 30.1cm = 31cm._
