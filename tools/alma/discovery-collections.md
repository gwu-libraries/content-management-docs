# Discovery Collections

Discovery collections are like book exhibits for the digital environment. They are curated collections of Alma titles that are displayed in Primo. Examples currently include collections of Special Collections resources and streaming media.

****[**LAI Collections**](https://wrlc-gwu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/collectionDiscovery?vid=01WRLC\_GWA:live\&inst=01WRLC\_GWA)****

## Policy

* We are generally happy to have LAI staff and librarians create collections that they feel will be useful.
* Top-level collections should be broad, and should always be created in collaboration with RDG. Please email [rdg@gwu.edu](mailto:rdg@gwu.edu) for assistance.
* Sub-collections can be created under top-level collections by any user with the appropriate role in Alma. No consultation with RDG is necessary for sub-collections.

## Process

### User roles

| Role                                   | Use                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Discovery administrator                |                                        |
| Collection inventory operator          |                                        |
| Collection inventory operator extended | Adds the ability to delete collections |
| Digital inventory operator             |                                        |

### Creating a collection

Collections are managed in Alma under Resrouces>Manage Collections

* Edit the collection under which you want to create your new sub-collection
* In the sub-collections tab, click "Add Sub-collection"
* Use the default settings
* **Use the same text for both the "Title" and "Name" fields** (these appear in different places and it gets very confusing very quickly if they are different)
* The "Description" field is optional but recommended--this text displays in the collection in Primo

### Adding titles to a collection

Titles can be added to a collection in various ways:

* Within the collection editor, you can add individual titles or add titles from a set
* In an All Titles search in Alma there is an option to add individual titles from the search results to a collection
* With an import profile--see advanced options below

### Customizing the collection

The header image for the collection is assigned as a "thumbnail image" on the General tab of the collection editor. Image files must be in jpeg, gif, or png format, and cannot exceed 100KB in size. We recommend that the image is at least 800 pixels in width, however, to avoid pixelation when it is used as the background header image in Primo.

The display order of titles in the collection defaults to "Relevance". We recommend changing this in the Discovery tab of the collection editor to "Title" or something else that makes sense.

Thumbnails for individual titles in the collection are based on Primo's automatically added thumbnails for titles based on ISBN and other standard numbers. Thumbnails cannot currently be easily added for titles that do not already have images.

If a title is withdrawn and removed from Alma, it will be removed from the collection. In all other cases, removing a title from a collection must be done manually if you no longer want it to appear in the collection.

## Advanced

### Import profiles

Use the norm rule for add upon import in the import profile. Use the 787 $w \[collection number], to add to the collection.
